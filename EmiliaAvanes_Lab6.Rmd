# 1. Write a function to simulate n N(0, 1) random variates using the Accept-Reject algorithm with a Cauchy candidate.

  x <- double(n)
  i <- 1
  r <- 0
  while(i < (n+1)) 
  {
    a <- rcauchy(1)
    b <- a^3 * log(1+abs(a))
    a <- rcauchy(1)

# 2. Simulate 1000 N(0, 1) random variates using your function to estimate E[Y3log(1 + |Y |)] and P r(Y âˆˆ[âˆ’1, 2]). Be sure to include a Monte Carlo standard error with your estimates.

fxn.cauchy(1000)

#3. What was the acceptance rate of the Accept-Reject algorithm? Is this close to the theoretical acceptance rate?

# Theoretical acceptance rate is much lower than the actual acceptance rate:

m <- 8*log(3)
fxn.t <- 1/m
fxn.t

```


#4. Write a function that continues simulation until the sample size is large enough so that your Monte Carlo error is less than  = 0.01 for estimating a general statistic stat (which will be a function). You function should also return the observed acceptance rate of the Accept-Reject algorithm and a Monte Carlo standard error.

#5. Use your function to estimate E[Y3log(1 + |Y |)] and P r(Y âˆˆ [âˆ’1, 2]) with  = 0.01. Report your estimates along with confidence intervals based on the Monte Carlo standard error. What was the acceptance rate?
